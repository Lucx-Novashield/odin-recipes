    <li>5 pounds of skinned pork leg</li>
    <li>1 cup of beer</li>
    <li>1 cup of orange juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of oregano</li>

   <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>We are going to start by blending the red onion, the white onion,
         the garlic, the oregano, the cumin, the pepper, the salt and the beer.
    </li>
    <li>With a knife we ​​make several holes in the leg of the pig, large enough
         for our finger to enter and to be able to dress it well.</li>
    <li>
        We put the pork leg in a bag, add the smoothie and the glass of chicha 
        de jora or orange and close the bag, leaving it to marinate for about 24 
        hours.
    </li>
    <li>We place the leg in a pyrex and put it in the oven at 200 o C, after half 
        an hour we take it out and bathe the leg with the juice that it releases.</li>
    <li>Cover it with aluminum foil so that it bakes evenly, but if you want the 
        leather to be crispy you can bake it without it, we leave it 
        for approximately 1 ½ more hours, that is, a total of 2 hours.</li>
   </ol>
